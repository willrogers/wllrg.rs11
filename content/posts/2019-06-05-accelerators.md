# The Diamond Light Source Accelerators

[Diamond Light Source](https://www.diamond.ac.uk) is a particle accelerator.
As part of my work there in the Control Systems group, I need to understand
the fundamentals of accelerator physics.

## Introduction

Diamond is a _synchrotron light source_, which means that it is a special type
of particle accelerator designed for producing high-energy electromagnetic radiation.
To do this, it accelerates electrons, first using a linear accelerator or **linac**,
then in two circluar accelerators: the **booster synchrotron** and the **storage
ring**. As the electrons turn through the bending magnets, high-energy photons
(particles of light) are emitted, directed through special holes in the wall
of the synchrotron and into so-called 'beamlines' that use those photons for
scientific experiments.

Diamond is tucked away in the Oxfordshire countryside, contrasting with
the ancient [Ridgeway](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Ridgeway) and
[Icknield Way](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Icknield_Way) paths, both
of which run past the Harwell Campus on which Diamond is located. The
campus itself was established on a World War II air base for the purposes
of nuclear research just after the war.

## Synchrotron Light Sources vs Colliders

There are many different types of particle accelerator, but the ones that
get the most attention are the huge ones at CERN: in the 1990s the Large
Electron-Positron Collider (LEP), and now the Large Hadron Collider (LHC).
The purpose of these machines are to accelerate particles to the highest
possible energies in opposite directions, then smash them together to
look at what comes out.  This was the process that finally revealed the
Higgs Boson in 2012.

Diamond is different. It's much smaller than the LHC, although it's still
quite large with an accelerator circumference of 561.6 m.
The electrons travel in only one direction, and we
keep them going as long as we can. As they circulate, they continuously
generate the electromagnetic radiation (loosely X-rays) that we need for
scientific research.

The emission of synchrotron radiation was a hindrance in early accelerators,
and it limited the maximum particle energy of (LEP) at CERN, but subsequently
it was realised that the emitted radiation could be useful and it is
the primary purpose of accelerators like Diamond.

Although this type of accelerator is not widely known about, there are dozens
of facilities similar to Diamond around the world.

## The Linac

See also [Where do the electrons come from?]({{ '/posts/2019-06-05-electrons' | url }}).

Charged particles such as electrons naturally accelerate if you place them
in an electric field, much like a ball running down a hill. The lowest
energy acceleration in particle accelerators uses a static electric field,
but there is a natural limit to the magnitude of static electric field
that can be maintained. If you try and raise it higher, it will be unstable
and an arc between the terminals will collapse the field.

To raise the energy of the particles higher, you can use oscillating electric
fields. If the particles pass through the field at the correct time, they will
be boosted to a higher energy in the correct direction. This also means that
if they arrive at the wrong time they will lose energy and be lost. This
effect naturally forms the electrons into bunches that pass through the
oscillating electric fields together.

Diamond's linac uses these oscillating fields to get the energy of the
electrons up to 100 MeV.

## The Booster Synchrotron

There is also a natural limit to the acceleration you can do with a linac,
simply because of its length: the higher the energy you want, the longer
the linac has to be.  This is solved by accelerating particles in a circle.
The particles circulate indefinitely, gaining a small amount of energy
each time, until they reach the target energy for the accelerator.

At Diamond, the electrons are guided from the linac into the booster synchrotron,
where they are accelerated from 100 MeV to the Diamond design energy of
3 GeV in a tenth of a second. The synchronisation implied by the name
'synchrotron' comes from the fact that the strength of the magnets in
the booster synchrotron must increase at the
same rate that the electrons gain energy.

## The Storage Ring

Once the electrons have reached 3 GeV, they are guided from the booster ring into
the storage ring, so-called because the elctrons are kept there for as long as
possible. As they travel around the storage ring, guided by magnets, they
naturally emit the light used for the experiments at Diamond. As they do so,
they lose some of their energy; this is restored by more of the oscillating
electric fields in certain locations around the ring.  These oscillations
are at a frequency of about 500 MHz, and since this is a similar frequency
to that used in radio, these devices are known as radio frequency or
(more commonly) RF Cavities.

## Insertion Devices

Although the electrons emit radiation as they go through the bending magnets in
the storage ring, that radiation tends to have a fairly wide range of energy.
It was subsequently discovered that you could produce more tightly-controlled
and hiegher-energy photons by placing special gadgets in the straight sections
of the accelerator. These are called **insertion devices** (I would have thought
that an insertion device inserted something, but apparently they are called
insertion devices because they themselves are inserted into the ring), and
are arrays of magnets designed to cause the electrons to deviate from their
straight path in carefully-controlled ways, emitting the desired radiation
as they do so.

## Science

The role of the accelerators at Diamond is simply to produce the photons for
science. Once those photons pass through the wall to the beamlines, the
work of the accelerators is done. In many ways, this part is less cutting-edge
than what the scientists do with those photons, which covers a huge range of
science and engineering. However, if the accelerator stops none of that
science can take place.

Hidden behind the few paragraphs above are a huge amount of details and the
expertise of a large number of experts. It is a tribute to them that Diamond
operates at all.
